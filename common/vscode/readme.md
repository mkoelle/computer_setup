# Visual Studio Code Extensions

## Prerequisite

[Visual Studio Code](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/vscode) has to be installed and be available in your terminal as `code`.

## Usage

Executing either file `install_extensions.sh` or `.ps1` will add my common set of extensions listed in the `extension_list.txt` file.

You can also list the urls for extensions to be installed by providing the `-WhatIf` flag when executing the script.

``` powershell
./install_extensions.ps1 -WhatIf
```
